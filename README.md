>  Many vote site have a rule in ip, that is to say, if you don't change you computer ip, you can just cast one vote. So we can use the proxy ip to request the vote, first we will fetch many proxy ips from some proxy ip providing site, than just do it. One more thing, so how to get the vote url? well, you just open the developer tools in browser, and click the vote button, the vote url will be captured.
